This folder contains “STLwriter” (within the Homework8 folder), which I completed for my Systems Programming course and is my largest 
C++ project to date. Throughout the quarter, our weekly homework assignments built on each other so instead of uploading each one, 
I simply uploaded this final assignment. Essentially, I built the complex program using my own data structures, algorithms,
and classes to be able to create .stl files (for 3D printing/modeling). It does so using functions I wrote to add or subtract
basic 3D shapes (spheres, cubes, lines) from a 3D grid of voxels. If you run the program as is, it will create three .stl
files showcasing the abilities of the program. For more info, see the comment at the top of each class, starting with main.cpp.

This folder also contains many of my labs for my Systems Programming class.
Because each project is an simply titled “Lab__”, below you will find a list of the topics covered in each project:

Lab02 = C++ Data Types and Overflow Errors
Lab04 = Passing Data by Value, Reference, and Pointers
Lab05 = Reading, Writing, and Navigating Binary Files
Lab06 = PackedArray Class using Bitwise Operators
Lab07 = C-Strings, Stack Overflow Errors
Lab09 = Cache Optimization
Lab10 = Simple LinkedList class
Lab11 = MyString class
Lab12 = Templates
Lab13 = Multi-threaded Algorithm
Lab14 = Threads and WorkQueues
Lab16 = Inheritance

A longer description of each project can be found at the top of each main.cpp file.
