            <h1>Study Abroad Blogs</h1>
            <p>
                In the fall of 2017 I flew to Cork, Ireland to start a semester abroad at <i>University College Cork</i>. In the following four months, I was able to travel throughout Ireland itself and around other European countries. I documented these travels by writing blog updates every few weeks (below), and by creating video compliations that you can check out by clicking <a href="videos.html">here</a>.

                    Hi Everyone!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This update is brought to you by Alex not wanting to do his homework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So after Oktoberfest I spent a few days on homework and making tacos and going to the gym. Then, one of my dad’s friends, Matt, happened to have a business trip to Cork so I hung out with him one evening! What started out as us just going to get dinner somewhere turned into us having six beers and a burger at 4 different pubs, so it was a pretty fun time. He gave me tips on internships and backpacking trails and all sorts of other stuff, so I’m really glad I got to meet up with him.

                    <h1>Dublin with Annie</h1>
                    <p>
                        A few days later, my friend (for 16 years and counting!) Annie landed in Cork and made her way to my apartment! We made some grilled cheeses and then I showed her around the city, stopping at a tower for a nice view of Cork and a few pubs (I made her try Irish coffee). We then met up with a few of my friends and ate some delicious gelato, bought groceries, and made a group dinner with tacos and guacamole.
                    </p>   
                    <p>
                        In the morning, Annie and I took a bus to Dublin and met one of her friends there. In Dublin, we:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Checked out Trinity College
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Had Irish stew for lunch
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Saw the Little Museum of Dublin
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Walked through a park (Annie had to face her fear of birds by walking by hundreds of pigeons)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Saw Saint Patrick’s Cathedral (yeah, the dude from the holiday)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ate more ice cream
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pub hopped
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Took the wrong train on our way to the Airbnb, forcing us to run to a bus, sprint to a second bus (which we missed), and sadly pay for a taxi
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The next morning, we slept in a bit and headed to the Guinness Storehouse (Ireland’s #1 attraction). It’s a really cool museum where you learn about the history of the beer, taste test it, pour your own pint, and drink it in the amazing Gravity Bar (look up a picture, it’s cool!). Then Annie left for the airport and I left for my bus back to Cork.

                    <h1>Copenhagen with Rachel</h1>
                    <p>
                        On Friday morning, I woke up at 5am to catch a bus to the Dublin airport (flying out of Dublin is almost always cheaper, but does add 7 hours of bus travel to the equation). I then hopped on a flight to Copenhagen to stay with Rachel for the weekend! When I landed I was greeted by, you guessed it, Rachel! We hopped on a train and went to her apartment to hang out and unpack. The rest of the day was pretty chill (or as the Danes would say, <i lang="da">hygge</i>). We went grocery shopping, made a delicious taco/guac meal for dinner, and hung out with her suite mates and a few other friends. After playing some games in the suite, a few of us went out to a bar and I tried some Danish beer (it ain't got nothin on Guinness).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next morning we woke up, made some breakfast sandwiches, and headed off on our bikes to explore all the sights of Copenhagen. Biking in Copenhagen is actually super cool; they take bike lanes and bike signaling really seriously due to the huge number of people who use them to get to work and such. Although the bike Rachel’s friend let me borrow was kinda sketchy, had back-pedal brakes, and switched gears on me whenever it felt like it, I survived. In the few hours while we biked around we saw a few big churches, bridges, tons of cool-looking boats, buildings, and DIS (her school). We also went to a palace and saw the changing of the guards, which is when the guards change and everyone gets excited for some reason. After biking back to her apartment, we hung out for a bit and then headed to a dock where we rented a tiny boat for an hour. It was really cool because we just boated up the main river/canal/whatever it’s called, looked at sights from the water, snacked, and drank wine. By the end of the boat ride it was raining pretty hard and by the time we biked back to Rachel’s place we were all soaked. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next morning we, you guessed it again, biked to the city center for some more cool sightseeing. After climbing up a tower and getting some footy for my next <a href="videos.html">video</a>, we biked to a really interesting and hard to explain neighborhood called <i>Christiania</i>. Wikipedia describes it as a “self-proclaimed autonomous anarchist district” if that helps, but it’s just a really cool place to walk through full of art and little shops and homes. We then biked to the beach, biked back to Rachel’s room, and then after eating food I headed back to the airport.

                        Study abroad has been a very very busy time with all the trips that have been happening, but this coming weekend I have zero plans so I’ll be catching up on schoolwork then (maybe). If you made it this far in the email I’m proud of you, I would have stopped reading about 5 paragraphs ago.

                        Peace out homies.

                <p>
                    Hi everyone! Long time no see. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you don’t want to read the following paragraphs and like watching videos instead, <a href="videos.html">click here</a>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    They say a picture is worth a thousand words. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My video is shot at 30fps (on average).
                </p>
                <p>
                    My video is 234 seconds long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, my video is worth 234 * 30 * 1000 = 7,020,000 words (or 7 sets of the entire Harry Potter book series).
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I’m trying to say is you should watch my video.

                    <h1>Cliffs of Moher</h1>
                    <p>
                        The weekend after the last update, I went on a day trip to the infamous Cliffs of Moher with my friends Ryan and Sydney. We bussed for around 3 hours to get there, stopping in a few small towns and a cool looking castle along the way. The cliffs themselves were really cool (I have pictures on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/alex.solorio.14">Facebook</a> that some of you moms got angry about…) and the walk along them was nice.

                    A few days later I got my green card at the police station, which was like going to the DMV but way worse. Then Ryan, Sydney, Suzanne and I went to a free comedy show at a pub near the city center, and one of the comedians tried some crowd work on Ryan and me. He couldn’t find any part of our lives to make fun of (surprisingly) so that was anticlimactic.

                    <h1>Ring of Kerry and Dingle Peninsula</h1>
                    <p>
                        The next weekend I went on another touristy trip with the same friends to the Ring of Kerry and Dingle (haha) Peninsula. The entire first day it was crazy rainy and windy (as seen in the video) so a lot of our tour guides announcements took the form of “if you look to your right, you should be able to see a great view of __________. I suggest coming again when the weather is better to get the full experience.” Although the weather was crazy we still had fun hanging out in the bus and at the various indoor stops. We stayed overnight in a hostel (which was way nicer than I expected) and wandered around the city that night, listening to live music and pub-hopping. The next day had much better weather, and we were able to see lots of Ireland’s beautiful western coastline including tiny towns, beaches, and castles.

                    <h1>Munich Oktoberfest</h1>
                    <p>
                        I woke up at 4am the following Thursday and hopped on a flight to Munich! I spent 5 days there so I could probably write far more than I want to, but if you ever want more info about anything just give me a call! On the first day I arrived at the airport in the morning and spent the day wandering around the city, getting used to the buses and trains, and checking out Nymphenburg Palace. The next morning, Rachel arrived (WOOOOOOOO) and I met her at central station. We went to Dachau’s concentration camp memorial, which was really eyeopening and saddening, and then headed to the Stoke campground, which is basically a hotel composed of rows and rows and rows of tiny tents you can rent for the night. The campground itself had unlimited beer and sangria, so it put us in the Oktoberfest mood pretty quick! That night we checked out Oktoberfest briefly, but went back to the campsite somewhat early to prep for the next morning. In the morning, we met up with Kara (a DU friend) and headed to the festival. It was really really fun, and we spent tons of time tent-hopping and making friends with Germans and eating schnitzel. The next day, we all took an awesome bike tour through the city and did some sightseeing. Munich is a super cool place filled with lots of old buildings, enormous public gardens, and of course the <i lang="de">Glockenspiel</i>. I highly recommend it!

                    <h1>Arrived in Ireland</h1>
                    <p>
                        I got to Cork on Monday almost two weeks ago after a long overnight flight to Dublin, a bus through Ireland, and a taxi to my apartment building. It was a long journey but it was fun trying to navigate all the public transit while finding immediate differences in city/street layout than I’m used to (driving on the left, etc). Once I got settled in and unpacked, I walked around the city a bit and found the nearest grocery store, which is in the city center about a mile away (sidenote: don’t call it downtown because you will confuse the locals). Since I got here I’ve made the walk to the city center at least once per day for groceries or buying pillows or going to pubs, so I’m definitely getting my steps in.

                    The second night I was here I decided to go to a cheesy-sounding event for international students called “speed friendship”. It basically involved sitting across a table from another international student and trying to talk to them over the sound of 200 other people doing the exact same thing right next to you, so it quickly turned into screaming “WHERE ARE YOU FROM” and “I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE MORE POTATOES TOO” directly into someone’s face for three minutes until it was time to rotate partners. Directly after the event, the man leading it (who works for an academic institution, mind you) shouted at all the students “Everyone follow me to the pub!” I got my first taste of Irish whiskey (bleh) and Irish beer with a French dude and an Irish dude and we danced it up and such.

                    A few days later one of my roommates and I went to a smaller pub with our new friends and played darts and pool. Two middle-aged Irishmen challenged us to a pool game and we almost beat them! They kept calling me “the Shark” because of my pool skills and they kept cracking jokes the whole time and it was fun.

                    The next day we adventured downtown and tried Irish coffee and it was pretty strange tasting. Normal coffee is definitely preferable.

                    Then I took a small trip to Cobh, which is a small town next to Cork and more interestingly the last port of call for the Titanic. We saw a giant cathedral and went to the Titanic museum and learned a bit about the history of that area of Ireland. I thought it was particularly interesting because I saw a few places that were mentioned in my History of Ireland class I took at DU last quarter.

                    The next day was my first day of classes. This week has basically been filled with classes and syllabi and the occasional nightclub. I’m taking a few computer science classes, a Remote Sensing class, a philosophy class and another Irish history class.

                    As for the future, over the next few weekends I will be traveling more around Ireland, and then at the end of the month I head to Munich for Oktoberfest!

                    I’ll leave you with a few things that I’ve learned so far:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The moment you open your mouth here, they know you’re foreign. This is shown in the following dialogue that took place two days after arriving:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lady on the street: “Can you tell me where I could find the 205 bus?”</li>
                            <li>Me: “I’m not sure”</li>
                            <li>Lady on the street: “Ah, you're not from here. Thanks anyway.”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You bag your own groceries here. If you wait for them to do it like I did they’ll stare aggressively at you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They call the bathroom “the toilet.” Even if you’re in a fancy restaurant you still say “where is the toilet?”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Casually drinking alcohol is very much part of the culture here. According to my campus tour guide, “There's two pubs on campus and they're a fuck ton of fun but we aren't technically allowed to promote them.” He shouted this at our group mainly consisting of Irish freshmen and their parents. (sorry for the language, Gramma)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sometimes you have to pay for the toilet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Employees ask <em>“are you ok?”</em> instead of <em>“can I help you”</em> and it threw me off more than it should have.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I have no idea when I’ll send another update but stay on the lookout for it! I’ll see you all for Christmas!
                </p>
