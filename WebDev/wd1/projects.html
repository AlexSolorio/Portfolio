            <h1>Coding Projects</h1>
            <p>
                In the two years I've spent in computer science, I have developed projects in Java, C++, Python, C#, and (now) HTML and CSS. In my courses, I have used these languages to create games, simulations, calculators, and other various projects that I encourage you to check out on my <a href="https://github.com/AlexSolorio">GitHub Profile</a>. For a brief summary of a few key projects, check out the descriptions below.

                <h1>Zombie Attack (Unity/C#)</h1>
                <p>
                    <i>Zombie Attack</i> was my first real dive into the world of game programming. I developed it as the final project for my Game Programming I class at DU. Essentially, the player navigates through the two levels by collecting ammo and trying to fend off the zombies coming from both sides of the screen. The programming involved creating a few GUI's, multiple scenes for the gameplay itself, and lots of calculations involving enemy AI and bullet/player movement.

                <h1>STLWriter (C++)</h1>
                <p>
                    I completed this project for my Systems Programming course and is my largest C++ project to date. Essentially, I built the complex program using my own data structures, algorithms, and classes to be able to create .stl files (for 3D printing/modeling). It does so using functions I wrote to add or subtract basic 3D shapes (spheres, cubes, lines) from a 3D grid of voxels. If you run the program as is, it will create three .stl files showcasing the abilities of the program.

                <h1>Binary Calculator (Java)</h1>
                <p>
                    In this project, I created a program that can add, subtract, multiply, or divide binary numbers using only binary logical operations. Users enter a calculation in the form of: <code>&#60binary operand 1&#62 &#60operator&#62 &#60binary operand 2&#62</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the answer is calculated behind the scenes, the program returns an answer in English, base-10 terms. For example, if the user enters:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>001 + 001</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then the program will return:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>1 + 1 = 2</code>
                </p>
