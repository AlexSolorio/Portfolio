SUCMS - Simple UDP Content Management System

This project was created for my Computer Networking course in Spring 2018.

Task: Create a UDP-based CMS that meets the following requirements:
-Allows for listing, reading. creation/modification, and deletion of files
-Each file action (list, read, write, delete) has a client program such that users can specify UN/PW and action to remotely connect with the server and control their files
-The system should handle files of arbitrary size

The server communication protocols are outlined in the four pdf files in this folder.

The four client .cpp files are to be used for the following tasks:
sucms_list: the client that sends/receives list commands from the server
sucms_read: client that receives remote files from the server
sucms_write: client that sends local files to the server
sucms_delete: client that deletes files from the remote server

The code for the server is not in this project, as the professor supplied a working server to us.

Upon completion of this project, I was able to run these four files on the command line to successfully complete all four tasks.
