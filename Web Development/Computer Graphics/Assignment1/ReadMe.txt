I created this project in my Computer Graphics course in winter 2018. 

Using the WebGL API for computer graphics, I created a simple drawing tool in JavaScript and HTML. Using the canvas, buttons, and color sliders provided, the user can draw rectangles of different colors ad sizes by using the mouse.

This was implemented using WebGL vertex buffers, custom vertex and fragment shaders, and the library found in the "Common" folder. This library was created by the authors of our textbook, Edward Angel and Dave Shreiner, so I do not take credit for any code found in that folder. The framework for the assignment was supplied by my professor, Mike Goss.
