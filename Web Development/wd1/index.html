                I grew up in Davis, California. Throughout my early education, I was interested in math and science but did not know how I could apply these interests to the real world. When I was accepted to DU I chose the field of computer science on a whim, and I'm now very glad that I did. I fell in love with the idea of using computers and code to solve problems after my first intro class freshman year, and have been progressing my CS skills ever since.

                I am currently studying abroad at <i>University College Cork</i> in Cork, Ireland. The last few months here have been filled with adventure; from celebrating Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany to biking around Copenhagen to pub-hopping in Dublin, I have been working hard to make the most out of this unique experience.
