This project uses a grid to represent a forest landscape with possible land values of DRY and VEGETATION.
It runs through thousands of trials using either the depth first search or breadth first search algorithms
to compute what the highest probability of vegetation for each tile could be so that the chance of a fire
spreading from one side of the forest to the other is less than half.
